# Table
A Java library to handle table structures in a very dynamic way

It allows for creation of a large table and filling in cells with data. Cells can be grouped into larger cells and inserted anywhere in the table with overlap checking. 
The rows and columns can be trimmed and empty rows can be removed automatically.
The structure can be exported into HTML code.
This is quite convenient to easily create large and complex HTML tables, but it is also useful to handle table-structured data for other purposes, e. g. exporting it to Excel (via Apache POI) or using a template engine (such as Velocity) for output.
